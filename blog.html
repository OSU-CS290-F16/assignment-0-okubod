    <h2>Assignment 0 - 9/26/2016</h2>
    <p>This first assignment was very simple and easy. I have previous experience working on web pages and websites and have learned many of the basics for web development through courses at OSU and online and through personal experience. I like to use w3schools.com as resource for help with remembering how certain tags are used.</p>
    <p>The tutorials and the first assignment were helpful for getting started and learning the basics of Github. I did not know how to work it very well.</p>
